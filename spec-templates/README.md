# Project Documentation

This directory contains templates for the specs to be used in the state repository. Do not change the files here. 
Instead use these templates to create the actual specifications in the project repository in a similar way. 

This repository maintains living documentation alongside code. Use the following folders in your **state repository**:

- specs/requirements — Product-level requirements and specs (PRD/SRS), acceptance criteria, and traceability
- specs/architecture — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), diagrams, and system design notes
- specs/stories — User stories, use cases, and acceptance tests
- specs/workflows — Agentic workflows, runbooks, and operational playbooks

Each folder contains a README with guidance and one or more template markdown files to standardize contributions.

General rules
- One artifact per file, small and focused. Link liberally between related docs.
- Prefer incremental ADRs to capture design rationale over time.
- Do not commit secrets. Use placeholders in examples and store real credentials in your local .env only.
- Keep documentation close to changes (update docs in the same PR as code where applicable).
